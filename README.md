# NXT-java
Old code that I recently found. This was part of my thesis back in 2011.

Main pourpose here was to allow a Bluetooth connection to a `Lego NXT Mindstorms` and control it using an Android App as a remote control.

Basic configurations to connect, wait for connections and close connection after the session.
